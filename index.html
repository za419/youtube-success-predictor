    <div id ="SummaryBody">Our goal is to determine what lesser considered factors lead to a successful Youtube channel. With the rise of the Youtube Celebrity, there is merit in determining what separates the obscure channels from the ones with tens of millions of subscribers. In particular, we have examined the success of Let's Play channels, in a way that can be easily repeated with other genres. This allowed us to focus less on the qualitative attributes of the channels and focus on purely quantitative data types. We created a program to scrape data from Youtube's API, then formatted that data and fed it into Weka.
    Our success attribute was based on subscriber counts of at least 250,000. We originally focused on million subscriber channels, but the successes were so few as to lead to a constant zeroR success.</div>
